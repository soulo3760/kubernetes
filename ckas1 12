kubectl config use-context k8s-c1-H
kubectl create deployment deploy-important -n project-tiger --replicas=3 --image=nginx:1.17.6-alpine --dry-run=client -o yaml >12.yaml
vi 12,yaml

kubectl create -f 12.yaml

under the 
spec:
  containers:
    -image: nginx:1.17.6-alpine
    -name: container1
    -image: kubernetes/pause
    -name: container2
adjust the metadata labels for id in labels and the selector matchlabels... also under spec adjust replicas
..
  there should onlu one pod of that deployment running on one worker node . We have two worker nodes,cluster1 worker and cluster2 worker.
  becasue we have 3 replicas, the result should be that on both nodes one pod is running, the third pod wont be scheduled unless a new worker node is added
in a way we kind of simulate the behaviour of the daemonset but using a deployment an fixed number of replicas.
  ....
  to achieve this we use pod affinity
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: with-node-affinity
spec:
  affinity:
    nodeAffinity:
      requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
        nodeSelectorTerms:
        - matchExpressions:
          - key: topology.kubernetes.io/zone
            operator: In
            values:
            - antarctica-east1
            - antarctica-west1
      preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
      - weight: 1
        preference:
          matchExpressions:
          - key: another-node-label-key
            operator: In
            values:
            - another-node-label-value
  containers:
  - name: with-node-affinity
    image: registry.k8s.io/pause:2.0
