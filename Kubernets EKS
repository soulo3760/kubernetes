kubernetes components
  master
  node
what components helps master control the nodes 
  container runtime -present in both master nad node -CRI
  - etcd 
  - scheduler
  - api server 
    - controller manager 
  - cloud controler manager - aws 

what components present in the nodes 
 -kubelet
  -CRI
  -kube proxy 

APi server
exposes k8s api which are required to interact with kubernetes
it has tools like kubekindle
etcd =  highly available key value database, stores cluster data- master and node, ip address, names...

Kube-scheduler
distributes the container across nodes
newly created nodes and assign container to them. 

Controller manager 
noticing when nodes go down
respond to the containers, nodes and endpointts to make decision to bring up new node or what to do
node controller, replication controller, endpoint controller, service accountant controller

cloud controller manager 
usually not present on prem scenarios, this contains logic related to AWS providers GKE, EKS
here we find ... 
Node controller 
router controller 
service controller 


NODE ARCHITERCTURE
CRI- underlyig software that runs the underlying kubernetes compoennets such as Docker, rocker, containerd
Kubelet-  agent that runs every node cluster
    - containers are running in a pod and on the node itself 
  Kubeproxy -  network node that makes the network rules on the cluster- for instnace communication within outside the node
